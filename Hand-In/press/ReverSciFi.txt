A steampunk platformer browser game about a space ship which, after a heavy fight, is heading rudderlessly towards a sun.

The player playing the mechanic, Ms. Scottocs, has to get to the bridge to fix it and find the way back into the engine room. The player has to manage both ways from the engine room to the brigde and back, taking into consideration which actions he takes: Using plattforms for evading enemies destroys the used plattforms and makes it harder to find the way back.

The prototype is played using A, D and Space.
